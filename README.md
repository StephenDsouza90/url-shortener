# URL Shortner

## Introduction

The term short url refers to creating a link which redirects to a long url when used. Users can use the short url instead of the original long url on websites, chats, e-mails, post, tweets etc. The purpose of a short url is that it is easy to remember, looks clean and uses less space.

In this application, a short url is created by inputting a long url. The short url when used is redirected to the original url.

## The Application

### SQLiteBackend

The SQLiteBackend is responsible for creating the columns in the table and making a connection to the database.

### Database

The database contains an ID, Original url and Short url column which stores the respective urls.

### Generating Short URL

The short url is generated with a Base62 encoder which includes 0 - 9 digits, a - z lowercase and A - Z uppercase characters. The function takes an integer and returns a unique code which is used as a short url.

The unique code is generated by getting the index (digit or character) from the Base until the divider gets the quotient to zero. By using the original url's id as the integer, this ensures that the short url's code remains unique when the index are concatenated.   

### Functions and Routes

1. Main()

The route in the main function allows users to submit a long url for shortening. Once the user submits the url, the page changes to the get short url function.

2. Get_short_url()

In the get_short_url function, first the original long url is stored in the database, then the id (the number) of that url is used in generating the short url via the Base62 system. Once the short url is generated, it is updated in the db.

3. Page_not_found()

If the short url does not exist or not created then a 404 page will return.
