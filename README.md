# URL Shortner

## Introduction

Short URL refers to shortening a long link so that users can use that short url instead of the original long url on websites, chats, e-mails etc.

In this application, a user can provide a long url which is shortened. The short url when used is redirected to the original url.

## The Application

### SQLiteBackend

The SQLiteBackend is responsible for creating the columns in the table and making a connection to the database.

### Database

The database contains an ID, Original url and Short url column which stores the respective urls.

### Short URL

The short url is create with Base64 (digits, lowercase and uppercase characters) and creates a combination of 5 characters long.

### Functions and Routes

1. Main()
The route in the main function allows users to submit a long url for shortening. Once the user submits the url, the page changes to the add url function.

2. Add_url()
In the add_url function, the long original url is stored in the database along with the short url. The short-url route displays the original url and short url to the user.

3. Redirect_url()
When the user uses the short url route, the redirect function redirects the short url to the original url. If the short url does not exist then it will return a 404 (not found)

4. Page_not_found()
If the short url does not exist or not created then a 404 page will return.
